Gradle issues:
---------------------------------------------
- No way to run 'offline' builds - http://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-320
    could possibly be fixed by an env variable that simply disables the remote repository??
- Update policy for maven SNAPSHOT dependencies. Supposed to work out of the box, but should be tested
    http://gradle.1045684.n5.nabble.com/Snapshot-dependencies-not-updated-td1433032.html
    http://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-629
- Eclipse projects + WTP, works as expected?
- Automatic dependency resolution between Jenkins jobs not possible in the current Gradle plugin.

- unit tests, reports etc.. checkstyle / pmd / findbugs / eclemma|cobertura
